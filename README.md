# nno-frequency-finder

Used in Nynorskrommet to find and analyze the most used words in nynorsk.
This project uses a [nynorsk word frequency list from Wikipedia](<https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Frequency_lists/Nynorsk_(NRK)>).

It also uses the Apertium translation API to compare this list to Bokm√•l.

It is a very specialized tool, and I doubt it will be of any use outside my use case.
